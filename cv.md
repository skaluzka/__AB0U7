I'm an enthusiast and daily user of free ("Free as in Beer") and open source operating systems and
software.  My IT journey began with C64 when I was 8 years old.  First years with my own computer
I spent - no surprise - on playing games!  Then, the next stage came - coding.  My first contact
with programming was simply copying various listings from the very first Polish computer magazines.
I have tried to change and modify them and watch the result.  That's how my adventure with computers
started and what’s more – it continues to grow still today.

During my education I had a close contact with IT technologies and hardware.  After graduating a
technical college I started studies.  After graduating with a Bachelor's degree I already started
working full time.  At the same time I began Master degree studies.

During all those years of my professional experience I’ve learnt a lot, but I’ve also realized that
there is still much to be learnt.  I have seen many things done badly or carelessly.  But the most
satisfying part is to see how things are changing from worse to better.  I was lucky to experience
it many times.

I can find various anti-patterns in software projects.  I even have my favorite anti-patterns.
These are: "Magic numbers", "NIH - Not Invented Here", "Programming by permutation", "Dependency
hell" and "Reinventing the square wheel".  I do my best to avoid them.

I like minimalism thus in daily work I try to follow KISS (Keep It Short and Simple) and DRY (Don’t
Repeat Yourself) rules.  I strongly believe in Murphy's law too! :)

I devote time to learn difficult, challenging aspects, even though (or because) it requires more
effort.  That effort, however, always pays off – it gives me a lot of satisfaction and increases
my confidence as a professional.  This is also why I like IT puzzles and riddles.  Solving them can
help me to understand how things are built.

I code with passion and I try to be compliant with "the UNIX spirit and philosophy".

I try to follow news and recent IT trends as much as possible.  I participate in few IT conferences:
FOSDEM, devconf.cz, confidence, pwning, pycon.pl, code::dive. I also watch YT channels, read tech
blogs and books.

I'm a moderate privacy-freak as well (moderate, but growing).
